## 📖 Overview

This project is a **9-key mechanical macro-pad** featuring a **0.96" OLED display** for real-time feedback. Powered by the **Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040** and running on the **KMK Firmware** ecosystem, this macro-pad represents my first complete journey through the full hardware design stack.
Built for [Hack Club Blueprint](https://hackclub.com/), this project was a hands-on learning experience.
